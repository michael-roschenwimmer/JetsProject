## Mike's Jets Homework Project

This is my week 2 homework project.

My JET FLEET program runs with only one Class (Menu)
and one method for that Class (startUP) being used in the
main method via an object of Menu being instantiated.

The program is mostly run out of the Menu Class which
coincidentally has the menu for the user to view and decide
what their input is going to be.

The user decides from 5 options:
1. List of current JETS in the FLEET
2. View the fastest JET in the FLEET
3. View the longest range JET in the FLEET
4. Add a new JET to the FLEET
5. Quit

Option 1) This option lists all of the JETS currently in
the FLEET of jets

Option 2) This option lists the fastest JET in the FLEET
and shows the user all of the JET details (except speed in miles per hour (MPH)) of the JET including the MACH speed of the JET. This only shows the MACH speed of the JET and does not show the speed in miles per hour (MPH). It should be noted that when the speed is converted to MACH speed it is rounded so that the MACH speed is a whole number.... i.e. MACH 1, MACH 2, MACH 3 and not MACH 1.2, MACH 3.37, etc.

Option 3) This option lists the longest range JET based on the
JETS range it can fly in miles as well as shows the user all of the JET details (except speed in miles per hour (MPH)) of the JET

Option 4) This option allows the user to create a custom JET
by inputting the model name, speed in MPH, price in dollars, and range in miles. NOTE: When the custom jet is viewed in Option 1 it only shows the speed in MACH speed, not MPH.

Option 5) This quits the program.






I didn't get to the stretch goals as I hoped.
I had to downscale to the basic requirements and will update the project when
I find more time to get to doing some of the stretch goals.
